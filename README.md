# canvas-api-functions

Development of functions for retrieving data from Canvas. The primary tool, the api_wrapper_function (and its inner function items_from_enpoint) provide a Python generator interface for an enpoint. Generators allow the client code to access the endpoint as an iteraterable thing (e.g. we can pull items out of the endpoint from within for loops)
